# WHO MI4A Publicly Available Dataset

## Background

Data accessible [here](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mi4a-2023-public-database). Accessed May 2024. 

We want to use this dataset to understand the number of operational manufacturing facilities that are based in Africa, and the number of vaccines they produce in comparison to other countries.

Analysis of this form has been completed before by Gavi (see [figure 5](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/document/2022/Gavi-Expanding-Sustainable-Vaccine-Manufacturing-in-Africa-2022.pdf)). We want to update this dataset (please see issue #1)
