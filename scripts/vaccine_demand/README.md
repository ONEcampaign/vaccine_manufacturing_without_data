# Linksbridge's Vaccine Almanac

## Background
The Vaccine Almanac showcases market information across multiple vaccine markets. Different sections cover different vaccines:
- Licensed and/or candidate vaccines
- Non-adult and/or adult vaccines
- Public and/or private markets
- Routine immunization, campaign and/or stockpile needs
- Traveler, military and hospital markets

## How we intend to use this data
Linksbridge data will show Africa's increased share of global vaccine demand. We do so in the `vaccine_demand.py` file, which produces figure xx. 

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is split into 6 main branches, each containing different sub-datasets. The dataset is structured as follows:
```
